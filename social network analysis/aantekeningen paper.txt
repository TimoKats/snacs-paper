INTRODUCTION

there are no strict criteria for aesthetics. 
However, the following points are generally desirable.
	- minimal edge crossing
	- evenly distributed vertices
	- depiction of graph symmetry

This article focusses on visualizing undirected graphs with straight edges.
Using force directed methods (others could be spectral method and high-dimensional embedding method).

Two limiting setbacks for this method:
	- settling in a local minimum
	- computational complexity of such algorithms
This was fixed with
	- multi level approach
	- Fruchterman and Reigold spring-electrical model
